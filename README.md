### Camera Positioning Requirements
- **Side View**: Perpendicular to bowling direction, full body visible throughout action
- **Back View**: Directly behind bowler, capturing run-up and delivery stride  
- **Front View**: Facing the bowler, showing frontal body alignment and lateral movement







## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Pose Estimation (`pose_est.py`)
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google's MediaPipe Pose model
- **33 Landmark Extraction**: Captures full body pose per frame
- **View-Specific Tuning**: Optimized confidence thresholds per camera angle
- **Output**: `*_<view>_keypoints.json` files with per-frame pose coordinates

### Step 2: Phase Detection (`phase.py`)
- **Master View Analysis**: Typically uses side view for phase detection
- **Bowling Phases Detected**:
  - **Run-up**: Approach phase before bound
  - **Bound**: Flight phase (lowest torso trajectory with parabolic validation)
  - **BFC**: Back Foot Contact (determined by ankle height comparison)
  - **FFC**: Front Foot Contact (multi-criteria: heel/toe + ankle proximity)  
  - **Release**: Ball release point (±30° overhead cone + peak wrist velocity)
  - **Follow-through**: Post-release phase
- **Advanced Algorithms**: 
  - Parabolic bound validation for genuine flight detection
  - Multi-criteria FFC detection (heel/toe contact + ankle validation)
  - Cone-based release detection with velocity confirmation

4. Locate release (overhead cone + peak velocity)
5. Synchronize phases across all views
```

## 🧮 Calculation Methods & Algorithms

### Key Phase Detection Methods

#### 1. **Bound Phase Detection**
- **Method**: Analyzes torso trajectory (hip midpoint) to find the lowest point during flight
- **Algorithm**: Parabolic validation ensures genuine flight phase vs ground contact
- **Output**: Start and end frames of the bound phase

#### 2. **Back Foot Contact (BFC) Detection**  
- **Method**: Identifies the landing foot after bound phase using ankle Y-coordinates
- **Algorithm**: 
  ```python
  # Determine back foot by comparing ankle heights at bound end
  back_foot = 'left' if left_ankle_y > right_ankle_y else 'right'
  bfc_frame = bound_end_frame
  ```
- **Key Insight**: Back foot is determined by which ankle is lower (touching ground first)

#### 3. **Front Foot Contact (FFC) Detection**
- **Method**: Detects when front foot makes ground contact after BFC
- **Algorithm**:
  ```python
  # Multi-criteria ground contact detection
  1. Search 0.4 seconds after BFC
  2. Check heel OR toe touching ground level (±5px tolerance)
  3. Verify ankle is near ground (±25px tolerance)
  4. Classify contact: 'heel_first', 'toe_first', or 'flat'
  ```
- **Ground Reference**: Uses back foot position at BFC as ground level baseline

#### 4. **Release Point Detection** 
- **Method**: Advanced cone-based detection with velocity analysis
- **Primary Algorithm**:
  ```python
  # Overhead cone detection (±30° from vertical)
  1. Search 1.5 seconds after FFC
  2. Check if bowling arm wrist is in ±30° cone above shoulder
  3. Within cone frames, find peak wrist velocity
  4. Release = frame before peak velocity (still in cone)
  ```
- **Fallback**: If cone criteria not met, uses traditional velocity-only approach
- **Key Features**: 
  - Ensures anatomically correct overhead position
  - Combines spatial (cone) and temporal (velocity) criteria

### Biomechanical Metric Calculations

#### **Release Height Calculation**
```python
# Method: Wrist position relative to ground at release
1. Get bowling arm wrist Y-coordinate at release frame
2. Use higher heel position as ground reference
3. Calculate absolute height: ground_y - wrist_y (converted to cm)
```

#### **Joint Angle Calculations**
```python
# Standard 3-point angle calculation
def calculate_angle(point_a, vertex_b, point_c):
    # Vectors from vertex to each point
    vec1 = (a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y)  
    vec2 = (c.x - b.x, c.y - b.y)
    
    # Dot product and magnitudes
    dot_product = vec1[0]*vec2[0] + vec1[1]*vec2[1]
    mag1 = sqrt(vec1[0]² + vec1[1]²)
    mag2 = sqrt(vec2[0]² + vec2[1]²)
    
    # Angle in degrees
    return degrees(acos(dot_product / (mag1 * mag2)))
```

#### **Velocity Calculations**
```python
# Multi-frame derivative with smoothing
1. Calculate position differences across time windows
2. Apply smoothing filters for noise reduction  
3. Convert pixel/frame to real-world units (cm/s, km/h)
```

#### **Trunk Flexion Analysis**
- **Forward Flexion**: Angle between trunk line (hip-to-shoulder) and vertical
- **Lateral Flexion**: Deviation from vertical plane in frontal view
- **Calculation**: Uses shoulder and hip midpoints for trunk orientation

#### **Arm Slot Angle** (Front View)
```python
# Bowling arm position relative to vertical at release
1. Calculate vector from shoulder to wrist
2. Measure angle with vertical axis (0° = straight up)
3. Provides arm slot classification (high, medium, low)
```

### Real-World Unit Conversion

#### **Scaling References**
- **Side View**: Elbow-to-wrist distance = 30cm (anatomical constant)
- **Front/Back Views**: Hip-to-hip distance = 35cm (anatomical constant)

#### **Conversion Process**
```python
# Dynamic scaling calculation
1. Extract reference measurements per frame
2. Calculate pixels-to-cm ratio: reference_cm / reference_pixels
3. Apply scaling to all measurements
4. Convert velocities: (pixels/frame) × scaling × fps = cm/s
```

#### **Scaling Strategies**
- **Median Scaling**: Uses median ratio across all frames (more stable)
- **Frame-Specific**: Individual frame scaling (more accurate for varying distances)

### Metric Calculations
- **Angle Calculations**: 3-point angle computation with bounds checking
- **Velocity Analysis**: Multi-frame derivatives with smoothing
- **Trail Tracking**: Historical position analysis for movement patterns
- **Composite Scores**: Weighted multi-factor performance indicators

## 🎥 Video Requirements

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjusting Thresholds
```python
# In pose_est.py - modify confidence thresholds
min_tracking_confidence = 0.5  # Default for side/back
min_detection_confidence = 0.4  # Default for side/back

# For front view (more lenient)
min_tracking_confidence = 0.3
min_detection_confidence = 0.3
```

### Adding Custom Metrics
1. Add calculation function to appropriate `*_metrics.py` file
2. Include in `calculate_all_*_metrics()` function
3. Add visualization logic to `annotate_video.py`
4. Update unit conversion if needed

### Modifying Phase Detection
```python
# In phase.py - adjust phase detection parameters
time_window_ms = 120          # Analysis window for metrics
cone_angle_degrees = 30       # Release detection cone
search_window_seconds = 1.5   # Release search window
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No pose detected" warnings**
